# eel-eco-calculator

### About

I created this project as an example for my year 10 students. They have been learning Python and I wanted a way for them to create a GUI for their programs. In my research, I found this [tutorial](youtube.com/watch?v=i38aKTn0WLA) by SB Developer on YouTube. This tutorial uses Eel to link a Python script with HTML and CSS. My students had learned a bit of HTML already so this was a great option.

This is my first project on GitHub and first time making something with Eel.
